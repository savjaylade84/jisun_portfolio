For me, coding isn’t just about writing programs—it’s about solving problems, finding smarter ways to do things, and creating something meaningful from scratch. I spend a lot of time working with Python, and I love how versatile it is. Whether it’s building small tools, automating tasks, or working on bigger projects, I enjoy the challenge of turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions."

Design is a space where I get to play with colors, layouts, and ideas, and I love how it allows me to make projects feel more alive and personal. I also have experience in web design, which really brings everything together. Being able to combine coding with design helps me create websites that are not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to use."
